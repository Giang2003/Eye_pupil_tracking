Project Description
This project involves the development of a real-time eye pupil detection and tracking system. The system leverages computer vision techniques to detect the eye region and track the center of the pupil using a Kalman filter. It uses OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical computations, and the Kalman filter for predictive tracking.
